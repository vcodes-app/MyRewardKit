        the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
        “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

      <h3 class="mt-6 mb-2">Service Providers</h3>

      <p>
        I may employ third-party companies and

        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

      <p>
        I value your trust in providing us your

        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic

      <p>
        This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on

          I do not knowingly collect personally
          identifiable information from children. I
          encourage all children to never submit any personally
          identifiable information through

          I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
          their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing
          their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services
          without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child
          has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services,
          please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
          of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
